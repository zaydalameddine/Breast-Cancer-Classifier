# Breast Cancer Classifier
 
In this project I take a binary database focused on breast cancer recognition from sklearn and create a model to classify a point as either benign or malignant

I also:
- created and trained a K Nearest Neighbor Classifier model
- split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets
- found the best k value for this data by finding the highest R^2 value for k between 1 - 100

Within the data file you can find the data used and a description on the researchers behind that data
